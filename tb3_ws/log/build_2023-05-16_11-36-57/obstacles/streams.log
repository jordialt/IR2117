[1.152s]   By not providing "Findexample_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[1.152s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[1.152s]   "example_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.
[1.152s] 
[1.152s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by
[1.152s]   "example_interfaces" with any of the following names:

[1.152s] 
[1.152s]   Add the installation prefix of "example_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[1.152s]   set "example_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above

[1.153s]   SDK, be sure it has been installed.
